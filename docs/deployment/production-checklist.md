## Rollback Plan

### Quick Rollback Procedure

1. **Identify Issue**
   ```bash
   # Check service health
   docker compose ps
   docker compose logs --tail=100
   ```

2. **Initiate Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Stop current deployment
   docker compose down
   
   # Restore previous version
   git checkout previous-tag
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Verify Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Check health
   curl http://localhost:8080/health
   
   # Verify functionality
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/probe/file \
     -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key" \
     -d '{"file_path": "/test/sample.mp4"}'
   ```
