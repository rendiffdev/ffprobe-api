## Critical Issues to Address Before Production

### üî¥ High Priority (Must Fix)
1. **Increase test coverage** - Current coverage appears insufficient for production
2. **Implement proper secret rotation** - API keys and JWT secrets need rotation mechanism
3. **Add rate limiting per user/tenant** - Current implementation may need refinement

### üü° Medium Priority (Should Fix)
1. **Add distributed tracing** - Essential for debugging in production
2. **Implement circuit breakers** - Prevent cascade failures
3. **Add automated backup procedures** - Database and file storage backups
4. **Enhance monitoring alerts** - Define SLIs/SLOs and alert thresholds

### üü¢ Low Priority (Nice to Have)
1. **Add OAuth2/OIDC support** - For enterprise SSO integration
2. **Implement API versioning** - For backward compatibility
3. **Add GraphQL endpoint** - For flexible querying
4. **Implement feature flags** - For gradual rollouts
